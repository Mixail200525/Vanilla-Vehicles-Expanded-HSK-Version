#Vanilla Vehicles Expanded HSK Patch
This is a reworking of the original VE under the conditions of HSK. The mechanics of the mod itself have not been changed. Recipes for crafting, buildings, equipment, as well as the research branch have been changed.
The mod has been tested and does not cause errors (almost). The test was performed on 1.4 and 1.5. 
P.S. The balance is made with an emphasis on realism, but if something seems wrong to you, then write in the comments. We will rebalance it.
